                        Welcome to my about page!
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Iowa State University.
                        Before coming to Iowa State to study electrical engineering, I worked for 6 years as an automotive technician at
                        Holmes Transmission and Auto Repair Inc. in Monticello Iowa.
                        While working as a technician, I received my associate's degree in automotive technology from Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I achieved ASE L1 – engine performance specialist and L3 – Light hybrid vehicle specialist certifications in addition to ASE master technician certification. 
                        In my electrical engineering studies, I am interested in specializing in VLSI and control systems design.
                        In my free time, I enjoy coding and reading.                    </p>
